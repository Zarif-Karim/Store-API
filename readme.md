### Store-API ###

Rest API for store like web app

This is a venture for learning how to set up API for web applications.

This project demonstrated how we can sort,filter and query the database
to give us the list of products based on user preference.

The Idea is that later we can connect this so some front end framework that
can dynamically update its pages through api calls.

Other than setting up the server and database schema (overall project structure)
Majority of the work is done in the /controller/products.js file. More specifically
in the gell_all_products function where we implement the sorting and filtering functionality.
